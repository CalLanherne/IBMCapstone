    "As there are many predictors, the first step will be cleaning the data and selecting the predictors. It will also be important to identify numeric data and categorical data for the purposes of one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue that is likely to occur is the undersampling of the target categories of interest. We are trying to predict 'Serious' or 'Fatal' accidents, but there are far fewer of these in the dataset which means any models built will have a bias towards predicting severities classified as 'Slight'. \n",
    "\n",
    "This could be addressed by downsamplng at random the 'Slight' accidents to have a similar number to the 'Serious' and 'Fatal' accidents. Alternatively there are methods such as the 'Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique' (SMOTE) which produces synthetic data based on the real data, in order to redress the imablanced data."
