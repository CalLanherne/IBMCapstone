    "Road traffic collisions pose a significant safety risk to both drivers and pedestrians. In 2019, the UK saw 1748 deaths and 25,975 serious injuries from road traffic accidents [(source)](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/reported-road-casualties-great-britain-provisional-results-2019). Whilst a downward trend has been identified, it is nontheless important to be able to identify predictors of road traffic accidents, for both number of accidents and severity. This is useful for allocation of resources (such as emergency services) - if there are conditions that imply a greater incidence of sever accidents, it may be prudent to increase the number of paramedics on call, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also useful to identify these predictors in order to further reduce the number of severe accidents. Identifying that a particular signage or junction reduces risk allows for local governments to make progressive changes to the road network in order to improve overall safety in the future."
