    "Road traffic collisions pose a significant safety risk to both drivers and pedestrians. In 2019, the UK saw 1748 deaths and 25,975 serious injuries from road traffic accidents [(source)](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/reported-road-casualties-great-britain-provisional-results-2019). Whilst a downward trend has been identified, it is nontheless important to be able to identify predictors of road traffic accidents, for both number of accidents and severity. This is useful for allocation of resources (such as emergency services) - if there are conditions that imply a greater incidence of sever accidents, it may be prudent to increase the number of paramedics on call, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also useful to identify these predictors in order to further reduce the number of severe accidents. Identifying that a particular signage or junction reduces risk allows for local governments to make progressive changes to the road network in order to improve overall safety in the future."

    "As there are many predictors, the first step will be cleaning the data and selecting the predictors. It will also be important to identify numeric data and categorical data for the purposes of one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue that is likely to occur is the undersampling of the target categories of interest. We are trying to predict 'Serious' or 'Fatal' accidents, but there are far fewer of these in the dataset which means any models built will have a bias towards predicting severities classified as 'Slight'. \n",
    "\n",
    "This could be addressed by downsamplng at random the 'Slight' accidents to have a similar number to the 'Serious' and 'Fatal' accidents. Alternatively there are methods such as the 'Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique' (SMOTE) which produces synthetic data based on the real data, in order to redress the imablanced data."
